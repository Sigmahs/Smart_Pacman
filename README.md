# Smart_Pacman

*Code not availiable*

Programmed an Artificial Intelligence that could "intelligently" play PACMAN. I used heuristics alongside various search methods such as A*. I also implemented !-learning alongside minimax and expectimax algorithms in order to provide the most skillful "player." A Bayes Net and Hidden Markov Model were added to deal with actions that happen by chance.
